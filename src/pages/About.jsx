                        <p className="font-extralight">
                            With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Simon Fraser University, I have built a diverse and impactful career in the tech industry.
                            My journey began as a <span className="font-bold italic">Frontend Developer</span> intern, where I honed my skills in creating intuitive user interfaces and enhanced user experiences.
                            Over the course of a year, I transitioned into roles as a <span className="font-bold italic">Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)</span> and a <span className="font-bold italic">Software Engineer</span>, contributing nearly three years of expertise to the industry.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            My passion for technology and education led me to my current role as an <span className="font-bold italic">Instructor in the New Media Design and Web Development</span> program at BCIT.
                            Here, I have the privilege of shaping the next generation of developers by combining my industry experience with a deep commitment to <span className="font-bold italic">innovative and student-centered teaching</span>.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I am driven by the belief that technology can create meaningful change and am dedicated to building solutions that are both functional and impactful.
                            My career is rooted in <span className="font-bold italic">continuous learning, collaboration,</span> and a commitment to fostering an <span className="font-bold italic">inclusive and equitable digital future</span>.
